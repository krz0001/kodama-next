      "1": "We are a Doujin/Indie circle, and we aim at showcasing the best kind of audiovisual works from people all around the world, be it in the form of video games, publications, music albums and more. The circle was founded by Fivda in 2017, for our first project, called KODAMA COMET -Stellar Sanctuary-, a visual novel still in development.",
      "2": "As you can imagine from the name, our circle is divided in two:<ul><li>KodamaSoft, for all things related to softwares and games.</li><li>KodamaSounds, for all things related to music.</li></ul>",
      "3": "KodamaSounds is our strong lead right now. With five albums published on <bandcamp>Bandcamp</bandcamp> and <booth>BOOTH</booth>, and many more planned for the coming years. We have the same publishing spirit as many other japanese doujin circles, but our ambitions are not focused on a specific series or style of music. Whether they’re for original work or arrangement projects, we want to feature as many artists as we can on our albums from new musical adepts to well known veterans. Please check out our list of ongoing projects if you wanna hop in!"

We authorize all people to participate in those albums, and we believe it is a good way for artists to form bonds with others while also permitting people to collaborate with people of all horizons to improve and create a good community experience, with no discrimination. No popularity contest, no favoritism: You wanna hop in? You can! And if you’re struggling, we’ll help out."
