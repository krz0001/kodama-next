## Blogposts

To add a blogpost, create a new file in the `_posts` directory. The file should be named with the ID of your post. The file should start with the following header:

```yaml
---
title: 'KodamaDirect 2024'
date: '2024-03-30T18:00:00+0200'
locale: jp
author: Robin
public: true
twin: kodamadirect-2024
---
```

- `locale` is the locale of the post.
- `author` is the author of the post.
- `public` is whether the post is public or not.
- `twin` is the twin post of the post. (if your post is a JP twin of an already existing EN post, you should put the ID of the EN post here, and vice versa)

The rest of the file is the content of the post. You can use MDX syntax to write the content of the post.
All posts are displayed in the homepage page in the order of their `date` field.

### About said listings

The information in the listings is used to generate the links to the project pages, as well as the recap inside the project pages themselves.

The `projects.json` file is structured as follows:

```json
[
 {
  "cat_slug": "eclectic-resonance",
  "projects": [
   {
    "slug":"eclectic-resonance-legendaria",
    "status": "accepting",
    "percentage": "0",
    "duration": "00:00",
    "finished_tracks": "0",
    "deadline": "2024-10-06T23:59:59Z",
    "mastering": {
     "status": "pending",
     "engineer": "R-Man (Resonant Union)"
    },
    "artwork_comission": "Pending",
    "color": "#d44215"
   },
            ...
        ]
    },
```

The file contains a list of categories.

- `cat_slug` is the ID of the category.
  - This ID is used to set the title and description of the category. They're set in `/locales/[lang]/projects.json`.
- `projects` is an array of projects.

### Project pages

Each project has its own page in the `/_projects/` directory. The file should be named with the ID of the project in the listings. The file should start with the following header:

```js
export const meta = {
    locale: 'jp',
    slug: 'eclectic-resonance-legendaria',
}
```

- `locale` is the locale of the project.
- `slug` is the ID of the project. This ID should match the one in the listings AND the filename.

The rest of the file is the content of the project page. You can use MDX syntax to write the content of the page.
