It is depicting the destroyed city of Okarthiel, nearly 200 years after an advanced magical experiment went wrong, creating what is essentially an arcane nuclear disaster. The fallout from this event has created a dangerous, bizarre, and magically warped environment that few mages are able to traverse."

The slow build of uncertainties, the hit of too much negativity at once, the way it can all suddenly shift, and the potential lack of resolutions. The emotional journey that takes place within, often in solitude, rather than externally. The track is experimental in overall arrangement and some key choices, and it focuses on meaningful expression over conforming to genre standards or prioritizing consistency in feel throughout.","","BPM: 120","Key: G Minor","Genre: Ambient/Experimental Electronic"

The voice in the song talks about the concept of a \"cybermind\" - a fully capable virtual mind functioning in cyberspace. I hope these elements make the song more exciting and mysterious overall.
