I never ended up releasing it, but when time came for Legendaria to close, I asked Emma if she would write lyrics and sing over it for the submission. She said yes, and turned the instrumental into a gorgeous song!","","BPM: 76","Key: B minor","Genre: Castlecore","","• Lyrics:","Could you hear me then?","Calling out your name when","No one else","Would listen","","The flowers, the swords within you","You're caught between worlds -","Your dreams obscure your vision","Your dreams obscure your vision","","But no matter what","You choose to do","I am with you","","But here alone beneath this tree","& this silver sky","There's a storm in my eyes","I stay the same so you can change","","Could you see me then?","In the center of the crowd when","You were being sent away","","I knew you'd find a way to stay ","I looked up at the stars","I knew that they were ours","","I knew that just as the sand","Cannot evade the blue sea","Your soul will break down their ","Walls just to return home to me","","In the woods, in the meadow,","Or down by the shore","I'll wait for you, as I have before"

It is one of my belief that JRPGs soundtracks did a lot of good for classical music. The extent of the influence of classical music in those kind of music is non-negligible and, as a result, an extraordinary amount of JRPGs got symphonic arrangements albums and concerts. A lot of those concerts, despite being held in usually classical venues, are often sold-out. Most of the people attending are young and not the kind to be classical concertgoers. The main instruments of this track are the violin and piano, two staples of western classical music, whether it is in chamber music or pieces written for large ensembles. The other instruments and sounds are almost all from an old rompler featured prominently in 90's RPGs, with most of these aforementioned RPGs seeing symphonic arrangements later down the line.","","BPM: 120","Key: G# minor","Genre: JRPG"

The title itself is a reference to a track from Chrono Cross often known as \"The Grasslands of Time: Home World\", and the influence of Yasunori Mitsuda is overall quite obvious. Other than that, I also took inspiration from various folk music, especially Spanish ones. The harmonies and melodies also shows some influences from a Japanese band named Choro Club, who themselves are primarily influenced by diverse folk music. Those are all pretty natural influences and inspirations of mine, so this track is kind of a candid love letter to them.","","BPM: 102","Key: Eb dorian (0:00~0:37) - Bb dorian (0:37~0:56) - Bb major (0:56~1:15) - Eb dorian (1:15~1:34); it then loop over so the same keys / modulations applies","Genre: Chrono Cross"

			"description": [
				"• Composer & Arranger: Monochrome","","• Programmed, Produced & Mixed by Monochrome","• Mastering Engineer: R-Man (Resonant Union)","","This track emerged when burnout was slowly encroaching. Earlier in the year, I had decided I would commit to Legendaria, feeling confident in my orchestration abilities after dabbling in fantasy music on two separate occasions. But the timing ended up being poor - my workload was the largest and most intimidating it'd ever been, events in my life had tested my will to press forward with music as a whole, and I was a little anxious about submitting to an album where I knew I'd be standing amongst giants. It seemed like everything around me was telling me \"no\", and so I got paralyzed by Legendaria, the task looking more and more daunting. My solution was brute force - powering through the turmoil because I figured I'd be better off for it. This track, \"Aeromancer\", is the result. The composition is soaring and triumphant, which I'm unsure how I pulled off amidst so much negativity. Jazz flavors are peppered in at various points, lending a slight chaos that the bright chorus section resolves beautifully. In arranging this song, I was reminded that this task should be one of joy and love for the craft, and it was easy to run with from there. While my circumstances will not improve immediately, I can always, without fail, forget my troubles with music, and \"Aeromancer\" is the proof of that.","","BPM: 122","Key: E minor","Genre: Orchestral"

The two main objectives of this piece was to give an impression of underwater using land/forest instruments, and to make it easy to listen to while being difficult to fully understand on a first listen. To get this \"ancient\" feeling, I decided to make use of traditional Japanese music elements such as Haraikotoba, Gagaku/Netori and hinting the sound of Shō and Uchimono using western instruments.","","BPM: N/A","Key: N/A","Genre: N/A"
