I never ended up releasing it, but when time came for Legendaria to close, I asked Emma if she would write lyrics and sing over it for the submission. She said yes, and turned the instrumental into a gorgeous song!","Could you hear me then?","Calling out your name when","No one else","Would listen",",","The flowers, the swords within you","You're caught between worlds -","Your dreams obscure your vision","Your dreams obscure your vision",",","But no matter what","You choose to do","I am with you",",","But here alone beneath this tree","& this silver sky","There's a storm in my eyes","I stay the same so you can change",",","Could you see me then?","In the center of the crowd when","You were being sent away",",","I knew you'd find a way to stay ","I looked up at the stars","I knew that they were ours",",","I knew that just as the sand","Cannot evade the blue sea","Your soul will break down their ","Walls just to return home to me",",","In the woods, in the meadow,","Or down by the shore","I'll wait for you, as I have before"

Best of luck in translating a game that's a grail for myself and the greater GHM community. HMU if you need another tester! also i dont like doing arrangements much so i chose a song nobody else would with as few melodic elements as possible LMAO"

Sorry, Travis. I love the sounds of Indonesian percussion, so there's a lot of gamelan instruments in this song, which I think fits pretty nicely. "

				"• Original Composer: Masafumi Takada","• Arranger: Monochrome","","• Programmed, Produced & Mixed by Monochrome","• Mastering Engineer: malicent (Cursed Monastery / Sigillum Azoetia)","","• Original Track: Cashmere Cannonball","• Source: No More Heroes","","• About this track: I run another arrangement project, and one part of it focuses on Suda51 works. I wasn't a prior fan of No More Heroes, and I had little interest in getting into it, but in doing work for this project, I slowly became exposed to the music of Suda51's games and found myself intrigued by what I heard. That primed me for work on Midnight Syndrome. My original intent was to arrange \"It's Kill or Be Killed Mix\" from No More Heroes 2, but due to time constraints and a lack of confidence, I opted for \"Cashmere Cannonball\" instead. However, I still wished to inject some of the jazz fusion flair of \"It's Kill or Be Killed Mix\", which is how I settled on this sound. For the end of the song, just to put a little more meat on its bones, I decided to mimic the drum pattern of \"Beam Katana Chronicles\", which managed to slot in pretty seamlessly as a breakdown. It took me some time to amp myself up for the endeavor, but I ultimately had great fun translating its electronic properties into a faux-acoustic setting and playing around with some recently-purchased VSTs."

It's a little bit hacky, but please enjoy! I put a lot of my favorite sounds in it. I'm starting to think this style is a little different from what usually goes on these albums..."

After working on a failed remix of another song from the game, I decided to remix Travesty instead, after relistening and realising it had perfect big beat riff energy, like the kind of thing you'd hear in a Tekken 3 song, so I went all in with the idea. Watch out for Jasper Batt Jr's new Big Batt album, The Batt of The Land. In stores never. [some sort of joke about Pizza Bat and the alias Pizzaman goes here]"

Takada-san's composition always stood out, and it has a consistency throughout his time with Grasshopper that gives their games of that era a strong character. \"killer7\" was my first Grasshopper game, and it made an extremely strong impact on me. I played \"The Silver Case\" later, and it affected me in different ways. While thinking about the project, I wondered if there was a way I could represent both titles in one track? For a while, I've thought that \"Apricot Square\" and \"Dissociative Identity\" both have strong piano melodies that could complement each other well, so I began with them. In fact, several elements of each track - melodies, chords, instruments - seemed to work together famously. I didn't have to make many alterations at all, just enough to keep things in key. I wrote a new bass line based on the roots of \"DI\", and introduced a second lead in the background to make the piece more my own. I think it still leans more towards \"DI\" than \"AS\" overall, likely because the former is a more developed idea in my opinion. I hope you enjoy it! I look forward to ever more unique experiences from Grasshopper. ^^","• Lyrics","kill the past","burn it","if you have to",""
