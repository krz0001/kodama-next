				"• About this track:",
				"YOKAI: This collaboration is a happy coincidence because it was almost abandoned by me, and VTQ gave it a new freshness. The Schranz style suits the song well and brings a heavy side added to the metal electric guitars.",
				"VTQ: Hi, Dan here. When I saw the ID posted by YOKAI, I knew this could fit well with a good SCHRANZ groove. A first mockup gave YOKAI the confidence to lend me his project, and it ended up being quite a nice collaborative work. Shoutout to YOKAI for an insane instrumentation, programming and arrangement; I merely cleaned up, mixed, and added more electronic elements to an already very good base."

Then I rebuilt it from scratch as a gabber song, but I got creative block after the second drop. I eventually  integrated the hardstyle part, but it feels not complete. Even though I manage to get this result, I have mixed feelings. I am happy I finished the song, but I am not completely satisfied with the final result. I think I won't make Gabber/Hardstyle for a while after this."
