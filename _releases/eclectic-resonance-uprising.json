				"• About this track:",
				"blobdash: blobdash here! First time collaborating with Fivda and it went really beyond my expectation. While we didn't keep a lot of her initial stems and ideas I believe I managed to keep a lot of the ambience and sound she had in mind, and Fivda really gave me good inspiration throughout the whole process. I really like how the progression in this track ended up, with a very melodic first half and a really \"harder\" tone through the second half. It represents very well the little story Fivda crafted and voiced. I'm very happy about how the vocals turned out as well! This is my first time submitting a track to KodamaSoft, hope you enjoy it!",
				"Fivda: Time for the UPRISING! This is the big titular song for our brand new ECLECTIC RESONANCE album series. I hope that it will serve as a good example of what you can expect from the volumes to come. It includes elements of drum'n bass, hard psytrance, frenchcore, for a good edgy and noisy potpourri of sounds! Working with blobdash on this was tons of fun- I originally intended to make a solo track, but was out of ideas pretty quickly. blob didn't find much use for the few stems I sent, and the bpm was pretty much the only thing that sticked, lol. I even intended to use a brand new alias for hard EDM, but I think i'd rather use it for a later time when I'll be doing something entirely on my own. I'm the one you can hear in the song, doing the edgy and cheesy narration, nicely processed by blob, who also arranged most of the track. I was mostly on the side giving structure and sound design ideas, while they filled the canvas in. They're ridiculously efficient at producing, and making a song with someone else in the same room as them is always so much more fun than doing it by distance. I also learned a lot of nice stuff that I hope I'll get to use sooner or later!",
