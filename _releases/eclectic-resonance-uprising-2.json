				"• About this track: This track was originally created for a Sound Voltex custom chart we made with a few friends, but it ended up not releasing. So, I made an extended version! Name is inspired by 1116 - It's a nod to my french friends who helped me decide on the name back in December and with whom I share a big love for 1116. Also the deadline was originally 2022-12-11 (11/12)."

Yet, despite the arduousness of programming ridiculously frenetic breakcore chops, the difficulty I had making a rhythmically reasonable trap section in 7/4, and the headaches I gave myself trying to properly mix the overblown chorus... it was all rather fulfilling. Maximal music tends to be tough for me, and it's always exciting when I pull it off to some degree. In this case, I feel like I've proved a lot to myself about my capabilities and knowhow."
