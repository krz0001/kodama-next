# ECLECTIC RESONANCE hollow horizons

*There’s always more to music than meets the eye. Sometimes, less is more. You may just need something to space out to. Something for those critical moments in life, wondering about what your next step in life should be. ECLECTIC RESONANCE hollow horizons is about wondering what’s next and contemplation, with ambient electronic beats for you to reflect upon.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“hollow horizons” is a variant of our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work albums, where the featured tracks are contemplative electronic songs. Ranges from traditional techno to more complex IDM, this album is particularly rich in its intended texture, ready for you to play at any time, any day.
