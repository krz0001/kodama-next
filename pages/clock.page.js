                    <b>The clock on the computer displays 02:55.</b>
                    <p>From the outside, most apartments seemed quiet, with the streetlights out. Most of the windows had their curtains shut, and every window in sight would seem to lead to a pitch black interior. For one exception. One wouldn’t notice just by glancing, but one particular window, with its curtains closed, seemed to let some artificial light dim out of the frames. Behind this window, she is sitting at her desk. Behind it lies a room, dimly lit by a desk lamp and computer screens. At this time, where most people tend to go to sleep, she was simply there, contemplating her past, her present, and what the world will try to present her next, seemingly captured by the sound coming out of her headset.</p>
                    <b>The clock on the computer displays 03:02.</b>
                    <p>The occasional sound of cars passing by the main street filled in the currently empty sound canvas, and acted as short stabs to spring herself back into reality, when the music wasn’t loud enough to mask it altogether. To her, this room, which once evoked memories of gentleness, comfort, and reassurance, now feels like a tomb of once better memories. How many times now, have such thoughts occurred to her? Drowning herself with sound was her only grasp back into reality, and she permitted such thoughts to give in every now and then.</p>
                    <b>The clock on the computer displays 03:10.</b>
                    <p>While browsing her many social media timelines, she would squint an emotion here and there. Artworks, heated arguments, a beautiful song, threats, inspiring messages… She has seen her share of it all, but somehow, she does not grow tired of it. She would have normally gone to bed long before, or done something else of her night by now. But this is one of those nights where she knows the night will not let her rest just yet, and so she just lets music project her into thoughts she wouldn’t be able to have otherwise, like an urge to fight those feelings, and move on forward one step at a time.</p>
                    <p>Feelings of unfairness.</p>
                    <p>Feelings of love.</p>
                    <p>Feelings of jealousy.</p>
                    <p>Feelings of unfiltered joy.</p>
                    <p>Feelings of anger.</p>
                    <p><b>Feelings of warmth.</b></p>
                    <p><b>Feelings of loneliness.</b></p>
                    <b>The clock on the computer displays 03:17.</b>
                    <p>She thinks back of simpler times. She thinks back on the time where she didn’t used to have such unpleasant outbursts of psychological self-torture. She always wished for an alternative to it all, she sure would prefer not having to deal with any of it. She thinks of the last time someone genuinely cared about her. She thinks of the last time she received a gentle and warm embrace. She thinks of the last time s□e felt comfortable ar□□□d □□□□□□□□□□□□ S□e thi□ks of the la□t words sh□ said to □□□□ be□ore she □□□□□□ □□□ ev□r □ga□n. □he thi□□□ o□ t□e □□□□ t□m□ □□□□□□□□□□ □□□ □□□□□□ □□□</p>
                    <p>No tears, nor any remorse. She could even smile, just thinking about it all. It all may seem long gone now, but the simple fact that she could experience pleasantness altogether is something she was forever grateful for.</p>
                    <b>The clock on the computer displays 03:29.</b>
                    <p>She cannot forgive herself for trusting people. She cannot forgive herself for being so blind. She cannot forgive herself for not grasping reality when she should have. She cannot forgive herself for being unaware of the people who cared for her. She cannot forgive herself for not understanding. She cannot forgive herself for not realizing things sooner. She cannot forgive herself for her leniency. She cannot forgive herself for not being able to forgive herself.</p>
                    <b>The clock on the computer displays 03:38.</b>
                    <p>Sometimes, she felt like she was part of a different universe altogether. She would often think, and notice that she felt as if she needed an entire life to make a single step forward. In such moments, presence feels like a grace, a blessing, to which you are ready to hold your dear life on to, and depend onto as if nothing else mattered. But then, whoever you were walking alongside with, suddenly outranges you and walks miles, without ever turning back to lend their hand towards you, the instant they let go of their hand. Such thoughts were often the reason for her deep sorrows, as much as she would like to hide them.</p>
                    <b>The clock on the computer displays 03:54.</b>
                    <p>But she cannot hide from them. All feelings of cynicism, of endearment, of tranquility, she uses as a façade to mask her vulnerabilities she cannot make public under any circumstances. Far too many times has she tried to, and ended up feeling it backlash upon her like a tide of immense suffering. More often, instead of reminiscing on the most complex questions out there, she simply states the facts - and tries to face much more fundamental questions.</p>
                    <p>"How did it come to this?"</p>
                    <p>"What can I do to ease the pain?"</p>
                    <p>"Just what did I do to deserve this?"</p>
                    <p>And no amount of time could let her reach any conclusions. And no one would magically pop and grant her wishes. As subtle as the summer night breeze, time flew by her before she could hear back from it. And the wind would not give in, nor would the seemingly unparalleled self-torture ever vanish from her thoughts.</p>
                    <b>The clock on the computer displays 04:02.</b>
                    <p>Her music served as a powerful blinding light to tear the emotions out of her, so that she could examine them - take a step back from them, to take a deeper and closer look from afar. That way, she could understand her own thoughts better. She knew that letting her emotions take the better of her was not the way to go. Neither did she ignore the importance of taking a break from her routine, and to give herself space. Doing all of this was necessary. It’s a tool she uses to better reflect on what she’s lived, and to learn how to keep going on.</p>
                    <p>For now, her withdrawal of what once was kicked back in. But she knows she can get over it. Because above all else, she truly, only wishes for one thing:</p>
                    <p>Being content in simply being alive.</p>
                    <p>And so, she lets herself be embraced again by the softness and harshness of the music before letting her thoughts go to rest.</p>
